# speech_recog
This is a project where I used deep learning libraries such as Keras and audio processing libraries such as Librosa, to create speech 
classifiers. In the main entry point, you can also run the command "--command predict" to do inference in real time with a model of your 
liking.

Inspirations of model architectures that I experimented with and modified came from here:
